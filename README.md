# leaflet_challenge_15
Homework for Module 15

This assignment connects Earthquake and Tectonic Plate data from a GeoJson API and Github link using D3. Then I used leaflet, HTML and JavaScript to create a map of the world that plots M4.5+ earthquakes that occured over the past 30 days. The map included 2 base layers (street and topography), 2 overlay layers (earthquakes and tectonic plates), and a legend for depth. The earthquake circles were sized according to magnitude and colored by depth.
